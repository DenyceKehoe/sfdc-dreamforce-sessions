By default, they must be the ones exposed to greater risk, the common thinking sometimes goes. But, thatâs not the case. Most companies with growing supply chains arenât immune to supply chain disruptions or their impact. They face many of the same concerns bigger companies do. Itâs the nature of business todayâcomplexity and risk are inherent challenges all companies need to manage, internally or with third-party support. Customers are demanding greater transparency into supply chains since any disruption to the flow of goods can severely impact financial performance and the brand of the company. This session will discuss how you can quickly build a more resilient supply chain.",

Based on the content-type HTTP header at run time, one of them will be utilized to parse any SOAP, XML or JSON stream returned from service endpoint. The parser also stores data values in a map structure. Developers can then use a set of simple API methods and XPath strings to retrieve any values out of the map directly.",

Organizations from all over the world are using Salesforce to bring their staff closer together and deliver impact. For Make-A-Wish International the objective of the Salesforce.com platform implementation was to strengthen global communication, accountability and efficiency through real-time information that is accessible anywhere in the world and satisfies the needs of fundraising, wish granting, marketing, and operations to achieve the vision of making every eligible childâs wish come true. With the user population over 400 licenses across affiliates and chapters in nearly 50 countries worldwide the ability to update wishes, manage campaigns, enter donations, and thank sponsors with mobile devices anywhere in the world created efficient and effective processes. In the first year of implementation, Make-A-Wish International gained functionality while eliminating over 2,500 hours of staff and volunteer time by utilizing Salesforce.com. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering and promoting effective solutions to global poverty problems. In close partnership with decision makers -- the policymakers, practitioners, investors, and donors working with the poor around the world â they design and evaluate potential solutions to poverty problems using randomized evaluations, the most rigorous evaluation method available. With more than 500 active user staff throughout North America, South America, Africa and Asia they use Salesforce to track the statuses of over 230 active research projects. They mobilize and support these decisionmakers to use these solutions to build better programs and policies at scale.",

But the new book from CEB, The Effortless Experience, uses over five years of research and tens of thousands of respondents to reveal that the âdazzle factorâ is wildly overrated. Consider this: what do customers really want from their cable company, a free month of HBO when they make a mistake, or a fast, painless restoration of your connection? Most customers donât want to be âwowedâ; they want an effortless experience. In this enlightening session, Matthew Dixon, executive director at CEB, will explain how a companyâs ability to deliver on basic promises and solve day-to-day problems drives customer loyalty. Beyond explaining these findings, this session will share how companies have reduced customer effort from management and frontline reps, along with the results they've achieved.",

In addition to providing full medical, dental and vision consultations and exams, they also provide extensive prevention and self-care education and counseling resources. After receiving services, patients who need follow-up care are referred to community resources that have volunteered to help. Salesforce1 for Nonprofits, including case management and communities, are helping Care Harbor provie a medical home for everyone who needs one.",

Alternatively, the best companies approach customer consensus with a completely different perspective altogether, designed not just to better connect individual customer stakeholders to them, but ultimately to better connect those same individual customer stakeholders to each other.

SolarAid uses Salesforce to achieve their mission goal: the eradication of the kerosene lamp from Africa by 2020. SolarAid was founded in 2006 by the UK solar industry. In 2008 they created SunnyMoney, a social enterprise which is now the biggest distributor of solar lights in Africa. Their approach is catalysing the growth of a major new market across Africa and transforming the lives of thousands of families every single day. One solar light means children can study an extra hour each evening, parents spend the significant savings each year on food, education and farming inputs. At Homeless Link they have built In-Form, a homelessness case management app that helpsmember charities record the work they do with homeless people. Launched in 2010 they have sold In-Form to over 50 of our members and now have over 6,000 users using Salesforce to tell the stories of tens of thousands of homeless people. In-Form is a fantastic example of how the Salesforce platform can be put to use to help the most marginalised, excluded and vulnerable. By partnering with the Salesforce Foundation to offer the system at a price our member charities can afford, they have been able to build a sustainable business that pays for itself without grant support and also generates a surplus that Homeless Link uses to support campaigning activity to advocate for policies to end homelessness.

You will hear the details behind truly innovative use cases for employee motivation and walk away with a new perspective on the types of strategies that can promote engagement and collaboration in your own healthcare environment. \n \nSome say gamification simply means adding fun and games to a workplace.

In a few cases, sales model can be built that exclusively use a digital revenue engine, however, the vast majority of organizations will be combining the best of what humans do (build trust, sense emotion, creativity) with what technology can provide (scalability, repeatability, and lower costs.) Humalogy based selling is the concept of re-architecting revenue engines to best utilize tools like CRM, automated marketing systems, social listening systems in combination with a human connection where needed. Get this recipe right and you will be able to build closer customer relationships and have more influence over them. Get it wrong, and you will slowly fade from relevance.

See examples of how Western Union's Salesforce admin used drag and drop functionality instead of code to build a Visualforce page that displays data in an Excel-like grid format used for an approval process. Milrose will demonstrate how they used standard and custom objects to recreate paper forms as Visualforce pages that automatically capture data for both desktop and mobile users, and reduce redundant data entry while considerably accelerating complex workflows.",

Consumers were the early adopters, but the businesses are driving wearables adoption and future innovation. According to an IHS white paper titled Wearable Technology - Market Assessment, roughly 50 million wearable units will be sold in 2014, and more than 180 million are predicted to sell in 2018. Perpetually connected wearables will enable workers, partners, and customers to experience new levels of immediacy, simplicity, and context in their mobile computing experiences. Wearables arenât just a consumer phenomenon; they have the potential to change the way organizations and workers conduct business. Powerful wearable apps are being created today that improve business operations and enhance customer experience, helping companies bridge the gap between existing infrastructure investments (ERP, monitoring, maintenance tasking) and their mobile workforce. But where do you start? How do you make a scalable investment in wearable technology, knowing their will continue to be iterations and advancements in the wearable hardware and software? Hear from leading wearable experts, check out live demonstrations of real industry & customer use cases, and learn how Salesforce Wear - the industry's first initiative for wearable computing in the enterprise - is changing the game by enabling an ecosystem of wearable devices and partners to come together and leverage wearables to connect with customers in new ways.",
